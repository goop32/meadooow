# meadooow

meadooow is a very basic start-page application that runs in your browser and provides you with the current date and time. Upon launch, you are asked for your name for greeting purposes. After that step, you're done!

## Settings

meadooow has two simple settings: light and dark mode. Clicking on the gear icon below the date allows you to select between either light or dark mode, and pressing the "close" button closes the menu. A setting to switch between 12- and 24-hour time may be added in the future.
